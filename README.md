## School_Disctrict_Analysis
## Project Overview
I have been tasked to compile several metrics regarding school performance and budgeting across multiple school disctricts to help determine future budgets and resource allocation. Upon completion of the initial analysis I was tasked to remove some of the perfomance information and update the over all report.
  
## Resources
  * Data Source 1: schools_complete.csv
  * Data Source 2: students_complete.csv
  * Software: Pyhton 3.9.2 64 bit, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4

## Results
  ### The district summary had several changes made to it with the removal of Thomas High Schools' 9th grade performance data.  The total student count changed from 39,170 to 38,709.  A difference of 461 students.  The change in head count affected the average scores and passing percenatges as follows:
  * math scores decreased by 0.1. 
  * math passing percent decreased by 0.2 points
  * reading scores were unaffected
  * reading passing percent decreased by 0.1 points 
  * overall passing percent decreased by 0.1 points
      
  ### The school summary was affected by the following:
  * math scores decreased by 0.7. 
  * reading scores increased by .05
  * math passing percent decreased by 26.36 points
  * reading passing percent decreased by 27.65 points  
  * overall passing percent decreased by 25.87 points
      
  ### These changes have caused a fluctuation in the schools' metrics, but Thomas High still remains the second top rated school despite the changes.
  * Replacing the 9th grade score has had the following effects:
    * math and reading grades remained the same across all schools except Thomas High which no longer has a score for thier 9th grade level.

  * Score averages by school spending was altered by the following:
    * average math and reading scores remained the same for the $630-$644 range
    * math passing percentage decreased by 6 points
    * reading passing percentages decreased by 7 points
    * overall passing percenatges decreased by 7 points

  * Scores by school sizes was affected by the following:
    * Average math scores increased by .05
    * Average reading scores increased .01
    *  % passing math decreased by 5.27 points
    *  % passing reading decreased by 5.53 points
    *  Overall passing percent decreased by 5.18 points

  * Scores by school type were changed as follows:
    * Average math and reading scores remained unchanged 
    * percent passing math decaresed by 4 points
    * percent passing reading decreased by 4 points
    * overall passing percent decreased by 3 points

## Summary
* Four major changes that can be derived from the updated grades are:
  * math scores across the district have been decreased over all
  * reading scores across the district have been descreased over all
  * passing percents for both math and reading were negativly affected
  * overall passing percenatges were also negativly affected
